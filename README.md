# HAML Version

Original work done by [gabetax](https://github.com/gabetax/twitter-bootstrap-kaminari-views) - I simply converted everything to haml.
I'm using it in a project with kaminari 0.14.1 and bootstrap 3 without any problem.


# Kaminari views for Twitter Bootstrap

[twitter bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites, including styles for [pagination](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#navigation).  If you're using [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) as your pagination library, the markup in its default views won't match the selectors used by bootstrap.  This repository contains modified copies of kaminari's views that you can drop in to your ruby application to work with bootstrap.

## Installation
* Step 1: Copy app/views/kaminari into your local Rails app/views folder
* Step 2: LEAVE ME ALONE, JEFF GOLDBUM.

## Compatibility
These views were tested with kaminari 0.12.4 and bootstrap 1.1.0 and 1.3.0.
